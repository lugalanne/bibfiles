	abstract = {In the last decade in Russia, the activities of looters of archaeologıcal sıtes have become more and more widespread. Every year, from early spring to late autumn, looters equipped with powerful metal detectors and other devices search for new artifacts damaging the cultural layer of archaeological monuments. Recently, due to the lack of written sources about the stages in the history of their development, some regions of the country have faced the problem that later developed into a key one. One of these regions is the Republic of Bashkortostan. The author's analysis of various sources revealed that the system of protection and preservation of archaeological sites in Russia is ineffective in countering looters, and is mainly aimed at combating negligent housing developers. In a wide information space, there are no analytical materials and scientific works that objectively reflect such illegal activities. In most works, only the damage done by the “treasure hunters” is stated. According to the author, one of the most accessible sources for researching the activities and subculture of looters are online communities in social networks. The study identified three groups of “black diggers” in the social network “VKontakte”. Using various software programs and scientific methods, subscribers and content were examined. Based on the results, the author concludes that the activities of looters are actively encouraged in social networks. In such groups, there are discussions on the findings obtained as a result of the illegal search for a “treasure”, effective methods and ways of avoiding responsibility, as well group coordination and arrangement of conventions.},

	abstract = {The trade in antiquities and cultural objects has proven difficult to understand and yet is highly dynamic. Currently, there are few computational tools that allow researchers to systematically understand the nature of the legal market, which can also potentially provide insights into the illegal market such as types of objects traded and countries trading antiquities. Online sales in antiquities and cultural objects are often unstructured data; relevant cultural affiliations, types, and materials for objects are important for distinguishing what might sell, but these data are rarely organized in a format that makes the quantification of sales a simple process. Additionally, sale locations and the total value of sales are relevant to understanding the focus and size of the market. These data all provide potentially useful insights into how the market in antiquities and cultural objects is developing. Based on this, this work presents the results of a machine learning approach using natural language processing and dictionarybased searches that investigate relatively low-end but high sales volume objects sold on eBay’s U.S. site, where sales are often international, between October 2018 and May 2019. The use of named entity recognition, using a conditional random field approach, classifies objects based on the cultures in which they come from, what type of objects they are, and what the objects are made of. The results indicate that objects from the United Kingdom, affiliated with the Roman period, mostly constituting jewelry, and made of metals sell the most. Metal and jewelry objects, in fact, sold more than other object types. Other important countries for selling ancient and cultural objects include the United States, Thailand, Germany, and Cyprus. Some countries appear to more greatly sellspecific types of objects, such as Egypt being a leader in selling Islamic, terracotta, stone, and wood artifacts and Germany selling Viking/ early Medieval weapons. Overall, the approach and tool used demonstrate that it is possible to monitor the online antiquities and cultural objects market while potentially gaining useful insights into the market. The tool developed is provided as part of this work so that it can be applied for other cases and online sites, where it can be applied in real time or using historical data.},

This was mirrored by an increased volume of Egyptian artefacts sold at auction, suggesting that looting is driven by external demand as well as by internal economic pressures.

Interchangeable participants are connected through single interactions to form loosely based networks. These flexible network structures explain the variability observed within the trade, as well as provide the basis behind ongoing debates about the roles of organized crime, terrorism, and the Internet in antiquities trafficking.

Results show signiﬁcant differences between digital data and market data. These demonstrate the limits of restricted quantitative analysis of online forums and the limits of extrapolation of market data with “culture-bound” measures. Regarding the validity of potential quantitative methods, social networks as well as online forums are used differently in different territories. Restricted quantitative analysis, and its foundational assumption of a constant relationship between the size of the largest online forum and the size of the metal-detecting population, are unsound. It is necessary to conduct extensive quantitative analysis, then to make tentative “least worst” estimates. As demonstrated in the sample territories, extensive analyses may provide empirical data, which revise established estimates. In this sample, they corroborate the detecting community’s own perception that they are ‘beat[ing these sites] to death’.},

	abstract = {Across Eastern Europe, professional archaeologists and metal detectorists testify that some archaeological sites have been emptied of metal objects, despite significant efforts to combat illicit trafficking of cultural objects. Yet there is little empirical evidence in relation to the scale of the problem within countries or its comparative scale between countries in the region. This paper presents open-source analysis of membership of online forums and social networks, as well as other empirical indicators, such as sales and ownership of metal detectors. It identifies and contradicts speculation and propaganda from archaeologists and detectorists, then offers empirical evidence in their place. It suggests the activity of at least 14,910 illicit detectorists in Belarus (around 1 in 638 residents), 54,066 illicit detectorists in Poland (around 1 in 702 residents), 26,377 illicit detectorists in Ukraine (around 1 in 1706 residents) and 75,158 illicit detectorists in Russia (around 1 in 1921 residents). It suggests that, in many of the worst-affected communities, above and beyond the technicalities of permissive, restrictive, or prohibitive regulation, the most important factors in the preservation of archaeological knowledge may be the economy and the rule of law.},
